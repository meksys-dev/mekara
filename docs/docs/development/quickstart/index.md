# Quickstart

There are two quickstart guides for different audiences:

- [For Humans](./for-humans.md): a fast walkthrough for cloning the repo, installing prerequisites, and running the Python + docs toolchains. These are symlinked to `README.md`.
- [For AIs](./for-ais.md): expectations for automated collaborators. These are symlinked to `AGENTS.md`.
