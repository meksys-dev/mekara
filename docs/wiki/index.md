# Wiki

This wiki serves as a how-to guide for various common software development tasks that you might want to perform. By documenting the exact steps required, we can ensure consistency of results across LLMs.

For example, do you always remember to setup Git pre-commit hooks every time you create a new repo? Do you always remember to enable branch protection on GitHub when you push that repo? These are things that the AI is entirely capable of doing, and yet unless you specifically request for these steps, different LLMs will set your projects in entirely different ways.

These guides are meant as a reasonable default starting point for the generic developer, and can be customized to your personal preferences. If you have any suggestions for updated best practices, please do open a PR on [the Mekara repo](https://github.com/meksys-dev/mekara)!

## Why not use existing tooling?

GitHub's [template repos](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) are generally tied to a specific stack. The same is true for tools such as [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/). Combining LLMs with written how-to's allows you the _bounded flexibility_ to recreate the same patterns across different stacks altogether. Just like with Mekara's [scripting functionality](/docs/), LLM output can be made predictable without sacrificing adaptability.
