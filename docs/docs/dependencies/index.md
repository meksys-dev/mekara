# Dependencies

Documentation for external packages that mekara depends on. These docs are comprehensive enough for reimplementation without consulting upstream documentation.

- [Click](./click.md) – Python CLI framework for building command-line interfaces with plain text output.
- [Claude CLI](./claude-cli/) – Claude Code (the CLI tool) data formats including JSONL transcript schema.
